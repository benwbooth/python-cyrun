=====

cyrun allows you to write cython code that runs like a scripting language,
with compilation happening in the background. Here is an example::

    #!/usr/bin/env cyrun
    print("Hello World!")

You can use the usual cython build metadata at the beginning of the
script to adjust compilation settings::

    # distutils: name = test
    # distutils: sources = 
    # distutils: define_macros = TESTMACRO
    # distutils: undef_macros = TESTMACRO
    # distutils: libraries = 
    # distutils: library_dirs = test
    # distutils: runtime_library_dirs = test
    # distutils: include_dirs = test
    # distutils: extra_objects = 
    # distutils: extra_compile_args = -Wall
    # distutils: extra_link_args = 
    # distutils: export_symbols = 
    # distutils: depends = 
    # distutils: language = c++

cyrun also adds the following metadata for searching for project-level module folders::

    # cyrun: base = modules # starting from script folder, search all
      top-level directories for a folder called modules, and add it to
      the include path and build path
    # cyrun: realpath = # if the script is a symlink, resolve it to the
      real path before searching
    # cyrun: ignore = # ignore certain folder names during the search

cyrun stores compiled cython libraries in a cache folder::

    - if CYTHON_BIN environment variable is set, use that folder
    - otherwise, if there is a .cython folder in the script folder, use that
    - otherwise, set it to ~/.cache/cython

cyrun uses the following environment variables::

    CYTHON_BIN - optional path to cached cython binaries
    SKIP - if set, skip compilation step
    CHECK - if set, don't run the module after the build step
    VERBOSE - if set, enable verbose build output
    FORCE - if set, force compilation
    DEBUG - if set, run cygdb debugger on the compiled script

Compilation is performed using distutils and cythonize(). Modules will
only recompile if source code timestamps are newer than the cached
binary file.
